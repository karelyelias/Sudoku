#### Project Overview
This project was developed as part of an Integrative Project, with the goal of creating a cognitive training tool through a Sudoku-based game.
The motivation comes from the fact that, as people age, some cognitive skills such as memory, reasoning, and problem-solving may decline. Sudoku was chosen as an interactive and entertaining way to help strengthen and maintain these abilities.
